In this case, if there’s no advertising and considering the reference category for seasonality (which is not shown, but we can infer might be ‘Autumn’ or ‘Fall’ given the other categories listed), the expected sales value is approximately 106.36304.\nAdvertising: The coefficient for Advertising is -0.09059. This means that for every one-unit increase in advertising, we can expect a decrease of 0.09059 in sales, assuming other factors remain constant. This is a bit counter-intuitive because we’d generally expect advertising to increase sales. However, this could be due to various reasons like ineffective advertising, the presence of other confounding variables, or multicollinearity.\nSeasonalitySpring: The coefficient is 3.69334. This indicates that, relative to the reference season (presumably ‘Autumn’), sales in the Spring season are expected to be higher by approximately 3.69334 units, given that other factors remain constant.\nSeasonalitySummer: The coefficient is -2.75086. Compared to the reference season, sales in the Summer are expected to decrease by approximately 2.75086 units, assuming all else remains the same.\nSeasonalityWinter: The coefficient is -1.43368. This means that, relative to the reference season, sales in Winter are expected to be lower by about 1.43368 units, keeping everything else constant.\nIn summary:\nThe model suggests that advertising has a negative impact on sales, which may warrant further investigation.\nSpring seems to be a favorable season for sales compared to Autumn, while both Summer and Winter appear to be less favorable.\nModel Evaluation\nEvaluate the model by examining:\nResidual plots\n\n\nplot(model, which = 1)\n\n\n\nNote: the residuals show a generally good fit. The residuals are scattered around the zero line without a clear systematic pattern, suggesting that the linear model is appropriate for the data. Any slight deviation might be due to random noise, which is expected.\nAssumptions of linear regression\n\n\nplot(model, which = 2)\n\n\n\nNote: The residuals are approximately normally distributed, which supports the validity of the linear regression model.\nModel performance metrics\n\n\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Sales ~ Advertising + Seasonality, data = sales_data)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-46.52 -11.20  -0.47  12.79  40.94 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

Let’s interpret the key parts:\nResiduals:\nThe residuals range from a minimum of -46.52 to a maximum of 40.94.\nThe median residual is very close to zero (-0.47), which is a good sign, indicating that the model doesn’t systematically overpredict or underpredict sales.\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept): The estimated intercept is 106.36304. This represents the expected sales when all other predictors are zero. Given the nature of the predictors, this value might not have a meaningful real-world interpretation.\nAdvertising: For each unit increase in advertising, sales are expected to decrease by 0.09059 units. However, the p-value is 0.645, suggesting that this effect is not statistically significant.\nSeasonality:\nSpring: Sales are expected to be higher by 3.69334 units in spring compared to the reference season (probably ‘Autumn’ since it’s not listed). This is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.481).\nSummer: Sales are expected to be lower by 2.75086 units in summer compared to the reference season. This is also not statistically significant (p-value = 0.599).\nWinter: Sales are expected to be lower by 1.43368 units in winter compared to the reference season. Again, this is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.787).\n\n\nModel Significance:\nThe Multiple R-squared value is 0.02003, which indicates that only about 2% of the variance in Sales is explained by the model. This is quite low.\nThe Adjusted R-squared is negative, suggesting that the model doesn’t provide a better fit to the data than a simple mean model.\nThe overall F-statistic tests the hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero (i.e., no effect). With a p-value of 0.7464, we fail to reject this hypothesis, suggesting that the predictors, as a whole, do not provide significant information in predicting Sales.\n\nIn summary:\nThe predictors Advertising and Seasonality do not seem to be significant predictors of Sales in this model. The model, as it stands, might not be a good fit for the data.\nFurther exploration might be needed, perhaps considering other variables or looking into potential non-linear relationships or interactions.\nWe’ll come back to this model in another post to see if we can’t improve it. Let’s move on and assume this omdel is adequate to fit data.\nPredicting Sales\nUse the model to predict sales based on new data:\n\n\n# Predict sales for new data\nnew_data <- data.frame(\n  Advertising = c(60, 70, 80),\n  Seasonality = c(\"Summer\", \"Fall\", \"Winter\")\n)\npredictions <- predict(model, newdata = new_data)\npredictions\n\n        1         2         3 \n 98.17672 100.02167  97.68208 \n\nNote: The prediction results based on the linear regression model are as follows:\nFor the first observation (1), with an advertising expenditure of 60 and the season being “Summer,” the predicted sales are approximately 98.18.\nFor the second observation (2), with an advertising expenditure of 70 and the season being “Fall,” the predicted sales are approximately 100.02.\nFor the third observation (3), with an advertising expenditure of 80 and the season being “Winter,” the predicted sales are approximately 97.68.\nThese predictions are based on the linear regression model that you previously fitted using the training data. The model attempts to make predictions based on the provided values of advertising expenditure and seasonality for each observation. It’s important to note that these predictions are based on the linear relationships modeled by the model, but the quality of predictions may vary depending on the accuracy of the model and the validity of the input data.\nConclusion\nLinear regression analysis is a valuable technique for understanding and predicting relationships between variables. In this post, we’ve covered the entire process of performing linear regression analysis with R, from creating sample data to making predictions.\nRemember that effective interpretation of results and continuous refinement of models are essential for successful data analysis.\n\n\n\n",
